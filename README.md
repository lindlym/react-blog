# Your React Blog (YRB)
By the conclusion of the second sprint of Array's bootcamp, you will create a blog that will allow users to see blog posts that you have created. This will include several different pages and give users an ideal experience to read topics that you want to discuss. The **interface** is entirely up to your choosing, but you will need to use the following technologies during the assignment. You will complete **three** different blog posts or more, three is the minimum. Each one will be done by a random person related to your blog's content and one blog post will be done by yourself. 

For example, a blog about Array Inc would include "Professor Lindly", "Eric Trowbridge" and "Amy Surdam" as the authors of the three blog posts (each would have one blog post that they "wrote" in your blog website). They should all be included in the "about the authors" page as well.

### Ahead of the Game #1 (Bonus for Honors)

Improve the blog website by integrating commenting into the blog pages. This should be done in a spot at the bottom of the blog post pages, which has a spot for a name and a comment field. After submitting the comment, it appears in a "comments section" at the bottom of the blog post. 

### Ahead of the Game #2 (Bonus for Honors)

Further improve the website by allowing users to sign up for the website. After creating a username and password, it should be encrypted and then stored inside of their local storage or it can use web tokens and cookies. It should have a "remember me" checkbox that will keep the user signed in. Requires a sign-up additional page with a styled form as well.
